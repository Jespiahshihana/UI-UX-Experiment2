# UI-UX-Experiment2

## Aim:
  To design a sophisticated mobile and web layout for an existing case study—Hanabana: The Real Elegance—by applying Gestalt principles, incorporating modern UI elements, and developing seamless interaction behaviors. The goal is to create a brand identity that reflects premium fashion through a custom logo and user-centric design.

## Algorithm:
**1. Define Brand Identity:** Establish the "Hanabana" aesthetic by creating an elegant logo featuring a female silhouette in a wide-brimmed hat, symbolizing high-fashion empowerment.

**2. Apply Gestalt Principles:**

  Use Figure-Ground to make the clothing "pop" against a soft, rose-pink background.
  
  Group related product data (price, size, button) using Proximity to reduce cognitive load.
  
  Ensure Similarity by using consistent "Dusty Rose" buttons across all platforms.

**3. Architect the Layouts:**


  Mobile: Design a thumb-friendly bottom navigation bar and a centered logo for quick brand recognition.
  
  Web: Implement a sticky header for effortless navigation and a "Lookbook" grid to showcase the collection.

**4. Define Interactions:** Create smooth scroll transitions and hover-zoom effects on images to simulate the tactile feel of luxury fabric.

**5. Audit Usability:** Ensure the system provides instant feedback (visibility of status) and high contrast for accessibility.

## Result:
The project successfully resulted in a cohesive digital presence for Hanabana. By integrating the "Real Elegance" logo into a structured grid layout, the design balances high-fashion aesthetics with functional usability. The application of Gestalt principles created a calm, structured, and balanced user experience that guides the customer naturally from inspiration to purchase.
